                Friendship is a selfless bond between two people. Having a friend you can trust with eyes closed is God's blessing.Friendship is a devoted relation, where both get the same love, care, and priority from each other.
                 At an early age, people come in contact with various members of the public, and they make many friends.A true friend cares, shares, and is always honest. 
                 Friendship is one bond that never ceases and lives on even if people are not physically close to each other. From sharing happy moments to sad ones, friends are the life support that helps one get through the most enjoyable and difficult circumstances.
                  The bond I share with my friends is one of my most prized possessions. Both of us inspire each other to become better humans. We push each other to do our best and we are always there in need.
                  A best friend is indeed a precious gem and I am fortunate to have found that gem of my life.</dd>
